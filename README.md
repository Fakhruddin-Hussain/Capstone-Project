# Capstone-Project
The main goal of this project is to improve customer retention and sales for an e-commerce company by using data analysis to identify trends and patterns in customer behavior.
To achieve this goal, I have several specific objectives:
  Analyze customer purchase history and product performance data to identify opportunities for cross-selling and upselling.
  Use the insights from the analysis to implement targeted marketing campaigns to improve customer retention and increase sales.
